Hi all! Level 0 rograamer here!

I was trying to start and learn Javascript, I installed NODE and such, started the introduction tutorial, but as soon as i try to open the file introduction .js, not a single app seems able to even find it.
I run my command prompt as admin, i do everything i all the tutorials and guides tells me to do, but the problem just can't seem to be solved.
Anyone can help me? Thanks in advance!
